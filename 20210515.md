## Coding interview

**sorted squared array**

1. brute force: iterate through the array, square it, and then sort it
   1. time: O(nlogn)
   2. space: O(n)
2. find the largest absolute number currently in the array, square it, and insert it to the last index in the output array
   1. time: O(n)
   2. space:O(n)
   3. this is possible because the input array is already sorted 

**tournament winner**

1. iterate through the competitions, and record the winning scores on a hash table, also keep track of the current best team while iterating
   1. time: O(n) where n is the number of competitions in a tournament 
   2. space: O(30k + 1) -> O(k) where k is the number of teams
