## Sklearn

If you pass prediction scores outside the range of [0, 1] to `sklearn.metrics.roc_auc_score`, it normalizes the scores to [0, 1] and then calculates roc auc.

## NLP - Question Generation

**evaluation methods**

Intrinsic Evaluation

- Subjective (Human) Judgements
  - Fluency or readability
  - Accuracy, adequacy, relevance, correctness relative to the input
  - ROUGE, precision, recall, F1
- Objective Humanlikeness Measures Using Corpora
- Evaluating Genre Compatibility and Stylistic Effectiveness

Extrinsic Evaluation

- measure effectiveness in achieving a desired goal.
