## Coding Interview

**product sum**

classic recursion problem

time: O(n) where n is the total number of elements in the array, including sub-elements

space: O(d) where d is the number of the deepest inner array 

**Binary Search**

time: O(log(n))

space: O(1) for iterative solution, O(log(n)) for recursive solution
