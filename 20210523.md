## Coding Interview

**Find Closest value in BST**

- sometimes, i miss the obvious. 
- keep eliminating the other half of the tree when traversing 
- time: O(logN)
- space: O(logN) due to call stack memory when solving recursively / O(1) if solved iteratively 

**Branch Sums**

sum of all the values in a specific branch

constant time operations 

- time: O(N) for visiting all nodes
- space: O(N) which is abbreviated from O(N/2) for storing all branch sums. 

**Node Depths**

calculateNodeDepth(tree_1, 0, 0) -> calculateNodeDepth(tree_2, 1, 0) -> calculateNodeDepth(tree_4, 2, 0) -> calculateNodeDepth(tree_9, 3, 0) -> 

```python
def func(alpha, beta):
	return n + func(a, b) + function(c, b)

```

**what is the difference between appending to a list and adding to a variable?**



## Programming

Helper functions

- helper functions perform part of the computation of another function. They are used to make programs easier to read by giving descriptive names to computations. They also let you reuse computations, just as with functions in general. ([ref](https://web.cs.wpi.edu/~cs1101/a05/Docs/creating-helpers.html))



## Github

github has changed authentication process from password based to token based. ([ref](https://github.blog/2020-12-15-token-authentication-requirements-for-git-operations/))

The token is called Personal Access Tokens(PAT). 

Details on creating PAT is explained on the [github docs](https://docs.github.com/en/github/authenticating-to-github/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/creating-a-personal-access-token). Also [here](https://www.learnhowtoprogram.com/intro-to-programming-evening/getting-started-with-intro-to-programming/creating-and-using-a-git-pat) for nice explanation. 

I think the answer on [this stackoverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/5343068/is-there-a-way-to-cache-github-credentials-for-pushing-commits) temporarily solved the problem of having to authenticate every time when pushing to remote repo using command line.
