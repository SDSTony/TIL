## Medium

[CoderPad](https://coderpad.io/) is an online tool used for coding interviews at Facebook. This [medium post](https://medium.com/swlh/cracking-the-facebooks-machine-learning-swe-interview-d625133fe966) shows how Facebook conducts their interview for machine learning engineers. Below is the 6 steps of approaching a problem during the interview which is listed on the medium post. 

1. **Ask clarifying questions:** Make sure you understand the question completely. For eg, what’s the data type of the array, is there any constraint on the length of the array, etc.
2. **Discuss your algorithm over an example**: After you understand the problem completely, make sure to come up with a medium-sized example to walk the interviewer through your algorithm. The example shouldn’t be an edge case at this point.
3. **Explain the time and space complexities:** Make sure to point out the space and time complexity of your solutions at this point and confirm with the interviewer that they are okay with the solution you provided.
4. **Code:** Once you know that the interviewer is okay with your solution, code it.
5. **Code Walkthrough:** Walkthrough your code with the example you took previously and make sure everything is in place.
6. **Discuss edge cases:** At this point, when your code works for a general solution, try covering all the edge cases.

If you want to put your experience working on open source projects, you should phrase it as `[Open Source Name], Open Source Contributor` 

Also, the takeaway of the medium post is that it's important to build an algorithm that can scale and serve many users. This phrase explains it well.

And that’s it about my whole experience with the interview process. **It’s more focused on your coding skills** since the purpose of this internship is to scale the existing Machine learning algorithms to Facebook’s large infrastructure, and not to write papers discovering new techniques. I was really surprised to know how hard it becomes to apply even trivial ML algorithms to the scale on which Facebook functions.
