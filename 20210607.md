## Coding Interview

**Find Three Largest Numbers**

use python's swap mechanism for efficient coding

```python
element1, element2 = element2, element1
```

time: O(n)

space: O(1) 

sometimes there are better option than sorting. optimal time for sorting is O(nlogn). But if we use the method implemented for this question, we can solve the problem with O(n) time complexity.
