## Coding interview

### hash table: storage for key, value pairs

- can access values from keys
- insert, delete, search operations are all O(1)
- in arrays, keys are 0 and positive values
- in hash tables, keys can be other data types

how to implement

- use hash function to transform keys to integers, then use the integers to access an array that has the values stored
- but, it's actually implemented with linked lists to prevent duplicate hash keys (hash collision)
- each node points back to the original key to know the keys of each value
- in the worst case, insert, delete, search operation time complexities are O(n)

In the implementations phase, many hash tables are implemented with functions that minimize these collisions, so we can think that most of the times, the time complexities are O(1)

### valid subsequence

try to think the other way around instead of approaching with arr2 first, try approaching with arr1

## Code Refactoring

definition: process of restructuring existing computer code, without changing its external behavior

- intended to improve the design, structure, and/or implementation of the software while preserving its functionality
- advantages: improved code readability, reduced complexity, which leads to increase in source code's maintainability and extensibility
