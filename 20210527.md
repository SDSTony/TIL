## Coding Interview

**remove duplicates from linked list**

time: O(N), space: O(1)

- if the given array is not sorted, we can use an auxiliary data structure that stores the seen values 

**Nth Fibonacci**

time: O(n), space: O(1)

can solve with constant space using only two slots for storing the recent two numbers

If we use only recursive functions, we get O(2^n) time complexity. 

fib(6) -> fib(5), fib(4) -> fib(4), fib(3), fib(3), fib(2) -> ....

It will have O(n) space complexity for call stack because the call stack saves the functions recursively until it reaches fib(2) or fib(1)
