## Coding Interview

**Depth-first Search**

time: O(V + E), space: O(V)
time is V+E due to the nature of recursive function, it calls it self and then the child nodes
space is O(V) for number of nodes stored in array, or it can be also seen as the number of functions stored in the call stack in the worst scenario when there is only one branch

**Minimum Waiting Time**

tiime: O(nlogn), space: O(1)
