## Coding Interview

time: O(nlogn), space: O(1)

- at first, I implemented an algorithm that requires O(n) space for storing the comparison results in a list size of n
- however, we can actually store the results as a constant value, or just return the value right away when the termination condition is met 
- also, it's important to check whether we are able to mutate the input array, because if not, it's going to take another O(n) space for storing the ordered list
